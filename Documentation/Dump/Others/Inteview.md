# Interview

Tell me about yourself ?

I recently graduated from the Computer Systems Technology – Networking program in georgian college, after that i have been building experience through internships and personal projects!
During my internship at Service Canada, I worked on Windows 11 system setups and lifecycle management. I handled the full process — from configuring new laptops for staff and classrooms to decommissioning old hardware.I also assisted with troubleshooting a basic network issue with an ethernet wall port that wasn't working. i also did internship At Dimension Tech, which helped me gain real-world experience with server and network automation. I worked on setting up storage on a HP ProLiant server and helped build a proof of concept for automating a data center using Arista switches and Ansible.I configured switches both manually and through Ansible, using the Arista AVD collection to automate an EVPN VXLAN topology. Through that, I learned the basics of data center routing.Alongside that, I completed Ansible Level 1 training, Azure Admin Level 1 training, and Proxmox VE advanced training. recently, I’ve been working under Waqas Sb on virtualization and Windows hardening for Thair Hall. I set up Proxmox distributed storage, built Windows VM templates, and performed Windows 11 and Server 2022 hardening using Ansible applying CIS-based security baselines
